{"story": "The nano-plague that poisoned Earth's water supply has reached its 60-year critical mass. The Unlight enemy forced the first exodus to the moon where the outlawed banished population was supposed to die. But now the Unlights have launched from Earth and are amassing on the south-west sector of the darkside of the moon for a massive ice-mining operation.\nIt is the last Great War and lunar troops are sent into battle for the precious resource. However, one squad is shot down and the five surviving soldiers find themselves stranded. Cut off and behind enemy lines, they start a dangerous journey through snipers and minefields back to their extraction point with only 36 hours of oxygen left. As their numbers dwindle and nerves fray, they make an amazing discovery about the moon that just might save their lives.", "view1": "After decades of contamination, Earth’s water crisis reaches a breaking point, driving humanity into exile on the moon under pressure from the Unlights. The same enemy now advances from Earth, gathering forces on the moon’s dark side to exploit its ice. As the final war begins, lunar soldiers are deployed to stop them. One unit is destroyed in combat, leaving only five survivors isolated far from safety. With limited oxygen, they move cautiously through hostile terrain filled with snipers and hidden mines. Fear and exhaustion strain their resolve as each loss reduces their chances. In the midst of desperation, the remaining soldiers uncover an unexpected truth about the moon itself—one that offers a narrow hope for survival.", "view2": "Sixty years after a nano-plague ruins Earth’s water, the Unlights complete their plan by pushing humanity onto the moon. What was meant as a death sentence becomes a new battlefield when the Unlights arrive to mine lunar ice. Declared the last Great War, the conflict sends troops into direct confrontation. During the fighting, a transport is destroyed, stranding five soldiers behind enemy lines. With only thirty-six hours of oxygen, they navigate a deadly route marked by mines and enemy fire toward extraction. Tension escalates as casualties mount and time runs short.

{"story": "The book follows an international organization named the Ministry for the Future in its mission to act as an advocate for the world's future generations of citizens as if their rights were as valid as the present generation's. Beginning in 2025, the organization, established as a subsidiary body under the Paris Agreement and based in Zurich, is led by protagonist Mary Murphy, a former foreign minister of Ireland and a composite character based on diplomats Mary Robinson, Christiana Figueres, and Laurence Tubiana. Climate change is established as a threat that compromises the safety and prosperity of the future. While the narrative includes chapters of nonfiction history and descriptions of events from the perspectives of other characters and objects, the plot follows Murphy as she seeks to convince central banks of the threats to currency and market stability posed by the effects of climate change. Specifically, a coordinated global round of unconventional quantitative easing through the issuance of a complementary currency, called the carbon coin, to be issued in proportion to the mass of carbon that is mitigated. The monetary concept, called carbon quantitative easing, is based on a specific real-life policy proposal, called a Global Carbon Reward, and an academic paper referred to throughout the book as the \"Chen Paper\".   In Antarctica, various countries cooperate in a geoengineering project to drill to the bottom of glaciers and pump meltwater up to slow basal sliding while the program incentivizes multiple other simultaneous efforts like carbon farming, sail-driven container ships for cargo and airships for personal transport.", "view1": "Beginning in 2025, the Ministry for the Future emerges as a voice for generations yet unborn, treating their rights as equal to those living today. Based in Zurich and formed under the Paris Agreement, the organization is guided by Mary Murphy, a seasoned former Irish foreign minister. Climate change frames every action as an existential danger to long-term stability. Through varied narrative styles, the story centers on Murphy’s efforts to persuade central banks that environmental collapse threatens currencies and markets. Her strategy focuses on a new financial tool: carbon quantitative easing, implemented through a carbon coin tied directly to reduced emissions. This economic approach is supported by policy research known as the Chen Paper. Alongside financial reform, nations collaborate on technical solutions, including Antarctic glacier stabilization and broader incentives for sustainable agriculture and transport.", "view2": "The narrative tracks the work of the Ministry for the Future, an international body created to defend the interests of future citizens. Operating from Zurich after its creation under the Paris Agreement, the organization is led by Mary Murphy, whose background in diplomacy shapes its strategy. Climate change is treated not as an abstract risk but as a direct threat to global security and prosperity. While the book moves through multiple viewpoints and historical interludes, its central arc follows Murphy’s campaign to reshape financial systems. She argues that unchecked climate damage undermines economic stability, proposing carbon quantitative easing through a newly issued carbon coin. Grounded in the Global Carbon Reward concept and the Chen Paper, this plan unfolds alongside cooperative engineering and agricultural initiatives, including glacier intervention in Antarctica and low-carbon transportation systems."}
